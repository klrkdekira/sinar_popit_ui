sinar_popit_ui
==============
Just a UI app to communicate to [popit](https://sinar-malaysia.popit.mysociety.org/) with extra stuff we need such as Post.


Development
-----------

First, clone the project from Github.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Sinar/sinar_popit_ui.git -b angularjs
$ cd sinar_popit_ui
```

Next, install the project dependencies. Bower package manager (bower.io) is needed to download additional project dependencies.

```bash
$ bower update --production
```

To start a local development web server, use the following command.

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 ...
```

Now you can browse to http://localhost:8080/ to view the page.
